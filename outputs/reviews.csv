I like this headset stand it works great for me the lights are cool my only complaint is I bought it mainly to be able to charge my electronics like my phone etc other than its intend purpose and none of the USB ports work it still looks great,Billy Johnson,"May 24, 2019"
"I love the LED's on it, it's so neat having a rainbow effect glowing over my desktop. I don't actually put my headphones on it as the only spot to put it is way too close to my monitor. I do, however, use it to hang a very dear necklace, and the little gems on it catch and reflect the light in a dazzling display! So there you go, don't use it for headphones but jewelry! ... Okay, maybe this really isn't for that. I did try my headphones on it though, some Microsoft lifechat(?) thing, heavier than I'd like. They worked great on it, didn't really bend, etc. Honestly my only complaint is how freaking difficult it was to get the posts into the USB hub-thing. Took me a good 10 minutes of trying and re-trying, very tight fit. On the plus, it's that fit that makes them not instantly fall out from headphones or shiny jewelry.

The USB ports work very well, I've had zero issues with any of them. I like to use it to charge my 3DS while I play it, as my main charging area for it isn't really close enough to charge & play. I feel like this is a worthy buy if you need something fancy to light up your area.",Eiskatze,"March 4, 2019"
"Very cool looking and works as described. Seems slightly lightweight tho. Hopefully, it will remain as sturdy as it started.",R. Black,"January 25, 2020"
Charges my headset while holding it up and lights up to match my setup,Jordan Padilla,"September 16, 2018"
The post for the headset is a bit flimsy but still works. The light is certainly nice but can be a bit bright if in your field of view while playing. The USB ports are nice to charge more than one headset as well as a controller.,Greg Coss,"May 29, 2020"
Looks nice,Israel Romero Figueroa,"December 4, 2022"
"However, it is not very sturdy and comes apart easily - just tap it. I finally put superglue in to hold it in place. It is a very pretty stand but I keep nocking it over when I place Head Phones on it. I think I will add a weight to the base next to see if that helps.",Amazon Customer,"May 1, 2020"
"I originally bought a rgb stand for more money than this one and was extremely disappointed. So when I got this one the other day I was ecstatic to have gotten exactly what I wanted. It is just as described. The lighting looks very nice and is soothing to watch. I wish the stand was a bit taller for large headsets, but it still works just fine. I charge my phone from one of the usb ports and am able to organize all my wires much better now. If you are looking for an aesthetically pleasing headphone stand, I absolutely recommend this one. I appreciate when sellers describe a product as exactly what it is; Nothing more and nothing less. And the seller did just that. Thank you!!",Sandra G.,"March 4, 2019"
I recently purchased a good set of gaming headphones and needed something to put them on that made them look as cool when I wasn't wearing them. This stand is perfect for them. I've actually had people ask me where I got this (I sent them link and told them to enjoy).,Timothy A. Taylor,"March 19, 2022"
"I love Enhance products and own more than a few,this stand was my latest addition,and like all their stuff,it matches perfectly.Yes w/bigger cans the acrylic support rods flex a bit,but it holds fine and is very stabil,I have a bigger set of Sennheiser gamers on mine and it does fine.The clear supports look very nice on every color or using the rainbow setting.If you're into RGB or things that glow and are colorful this stand is for you.As for a hub,it is fairly useful but as it is only 2.0 it isnt to good for data transfer,but to me it really doesnt matter,I knew what it was before i bought it and it is everything i expected.",Amra,"February 17, 2019"
"pros
- looks cool
- looks cool
- looks cool
- functional USB ports
- does the intended job
- sturdy and does not tip, even when heavy-ish headphones are on it, despite having a small footprint

cons
- the acrylic poles with embedded gas bubbles are flimsy (""flexible"") and can bend/bow when heavier headphones are placed on them. but does not affect the functionality

If you want something that looks like a light up accessory from Tron, then this is your item. It looks fairly futuristic and the USB ports are a great bonus.. This is the perfect compliment to your colored LED keyboard, mouse, and headphone setup.

"Got this for my son who loves to game on both his game box and computer. It's just a neat way for him to hang up his headphones and charge them. Keeps them off the chair or bed where they can get stepped on or knocked off.
The lights look really cool when he's playing games in the dark. He liked them so much he bought them for his two best friends and they love them, too.",mary d.,"February 26, 2020"
A little flimsy but good for the most part,Whitney Brown,"July 7, 2021"
"Bought this for my sons bday, he is into rgb now. He has a computer that is rgb, keyboard, mouse, monitors and the headphone stand which is rgb. He can change it to any color he wants or multiple colors. He really likes it and it is durable and holds the headphones really well. Of course if that are a little heavy the piece that hold them up will flex a little bit. He is happy with it and it was a good buy.",Jody Arms,"November 2, 2018"
I was looking for varius gamming headset and this one worked the part. The RGB is a nice touch and it sounds awsome for its price. So far i been using them for a few month and both the sound and mic work like its brand new.,Jose R Chevere,"February 21, 2021"
